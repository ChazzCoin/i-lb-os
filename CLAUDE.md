# CLAUDE.md

Working context for Claude Code sessions on this repo. Read this
before making non-trivial changes.

> This file is **project-specific**. It overrides and extends the
> generic foundation in `.claude/task-rules.md`. Update the
> placeholders below for this project. The kit's `/sync` will never
> overwrite this file — it's yours to evolve.

## 🪡 Auto-loaded primitives

Claude Code follows `@`-imports here. The kit ships a set of small
primitive files that should be loaded on every session — leave the
imports below in place unless you've removed the corresponding
file. Delete a line if the file isn't used in this project.

@.claude/welcome.md
@.claude/pact.md
@.claude/mode.md
@.claude/bookmarks.md
@.claude/wont-do.md
@docs/notes/INDEX.md

*Why each one:*
- **`welcome.md`** — first-thing context: where you left off, what's
  in flight. Auto-updated by `/handoff`.
- **`pact.md`** — your working-relationship preferences with Claude.
  Portable across repos.
- **`mode.md`** — currently-active work mode (a *drive*, not a
  filter). Only present when a mode is active. When loaded, its
  drive prose shapes Claude's appetite for the session. Switch with
  `/mode <name>`; clear with `/mode normal`. See the kit's
  `kit/modes/README.md` for the concept.
- **`bookmarks.md`** — curated `path:line` pointers for fast
  orientation.
- **`wont-do.md`** — anti-feature list. Stops relitigating closed
  conversations.
- **`docs/notes/INDEX.md`** — rolling index of `/lessons` notes.
  Future Claude sessions read prior learnings on session start.

If your project uses `/inbox`, add `@.claude/inbox/<your-handle>.md`
to load your messages on session start.

**Project terminology overrides.** Define any project-specific
meanings of kit terms (versioning, lifecycle states, verification
gate, etc.) in `.claude/vocabulary-overrides.md`. Defaults are in
`.claude/vocabulary.md`.

## What this is

{{ONE-PARAGRAPH PROJECT DESCRIPTION — what does this project do, who
uses it, why does it exist? Be specific. Not marketing. Replace this
text.}}

## Platform

{{Declare the project's platform so universal skills (especially
`/release`) can find the right platform-specific extensions.}}

**Platform:** {{ios | web | python | android | backend | universal}}

When this is set, agents read the matching `.claude/<platform>-*.md`
files (e.g. `.claude/ios-task-rules.md`,
`.claude/ios-conventions.md`) alongside the universal
`.claude/task-rules.md`. Multi-platform projects can list more than
one — e.g. `ios + python` for an iOS app talking to a Python API,
or `web + python` for a web frontend with a Python backend.
Agents will read all relevant prefix files for cross-boundary work.

If `universal`, only the unprefixed kit files apply — useful for
docs sites, libraries, or projects whose platform isn't yet
represented in the kit.

The `/release` skill detects this declaration first, then falls
back to inferring from manifest files (`*.xcodeproj` → ios,
`pyproject.toml` → python, `package.json` → web, etc.).

## Tech stack

{{LIST THE STACK — language(s), framework(s), runtime(s), key
libraries, databases, hosting, third-party services. Anything that
would change how someone reads the code.}}

Examples to delete:
- Vite 6 + React 18 + Tailwind 3
- Firebase (Auth + Realtime Database)
- Node 20+ required

## Commands

The skills (`/build`, `/run`, `/release`) and the verification gate
in `task-rules.md` discover commands from this section. Fill them in
once and the rest of the kit picks them up.

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| **Build** | `{{BUILD COMMAND — e.g. npm run build, cargo build, ./gradlew build, swift build}}` |
| **Run / dev** | `{{RUN COMMAND — e.g. npm run dev, cargo run, python main.py}}` |
| **Test (verification gate)** | `{{HEADLESS TEST COMMAND — e.g. npm run test:e2e, pytest, go test ./..., cargo test}}` |
| **Test (focused / watched)** | `{{FILTERED OR WATCHED TEST COMMAND — e.g. npm run test:e2e:watch -- TASK-XXX}}` |
| **Test (parade — final review)** | `{{FULL HEADED SUITE — e.g. npm run test:e2e:watch}}` |
| **Deploy** | `{{DEPLOY COMMAND — e.g. npm run deploy, fastlane release}}` |
| **Rollback** | `{{ROLLBACK COMMAND — e.g. firebase hosting:rollback, kubectl rollout undo}}` |
| **Dependency audit** | `{{AUDIT COMMAND — e.g. npm audit, cargo audit, pip-audit}}` |

If any of these don't apply, write `n/a` and leave a one-line note.

## Toolchain pinning

{{LIST VERSION PINS THE PROJECT REQUIRES — node version, python
version, ruby version, xcode version, etc. Note where they're
pinned (.nvmrc, .tool-versions, etc.).}}

Example to delete:
- Node 20+ required (`.nvmrc`). For non-interactive shells:
  `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && nvm use`

## Folder layout

```
{{TOP-LEVEL DIRECTORY TREE — what's where, with one-line annotations.
Don't enumerate every file; just the structure that orients a reader.}}
```

## Schema ownership

{{IF THIS PROJECT MIRRORS AN EXTERNALLY-OWNED SCHEMA, document it here.
Who owns it? Where is the canonical source? What's the discipline?

If the project owns its own schema, delete this section and replace
with: "This project owns its own schema; no external mirror discipline
applies."}}

Example to delete:
> iOS owns the schema. Field names are byte-identical to Realm classes.
> The canonical source lives at `../ios-app/Sources/Models/`. Use
> `/schema-check` to reconcile.

## Schema registry

{{IF THIS PROJECT HAS A FILE THAT REGISTERS ALL DATA PATHS / TYPES /
COLLECTIONS, identify it here. The schema-discipline rule references
this file. Delete this section if not applicable.}}

Example to delete:
> `src/firebase/paths.js` is the canonical registry of all RTDB
> collections. Any new collection must be added there. Don't bypass
> with one-off `ref(rtdb, "...")` calls.

## Gated files (project-specific extensions)

The kit's `task-rules.md` lists generic gated-file categories.
This section adds project-specific ones:

{{LIST FILES OR DIRECTORIES THAT REQUIRE EXPLICIT PERMISSION TO TOUCH
IN THIS PROJECT BEYOND THE GENERIC LIST. Things like critical config,
security rules, generated code, vendored files. Delete if no extras.}}

## Local dev

{{HOW TO GET A FRESH CLONE RUNNING. Step-by-step — install deps, env
vars, secrets, run command, expected output. The goal: a new
contributor can clone and be running in 10 minutes.}}

## Environment variables

{{LIST ENV VARS THE PROJECT READS. Reference .env.example as the
authoritative list. Note any that are required vs optional.}}

## Test infrastructure

{{IF THE PROJECT HAS NON-OBVIOUS TEST SETUP — test accounts, fixture
data, emulator vs production targets, etc. — document it here. The
test-pairing convention also lives here:}}

**Test/task pairing:** {{e.g. "every E2E spec is paired 1:1 with a
task. Filename `e2e/tests/TASK-XXX-slug.spec.js` matches the task ID
and slug. The first line of the spec links back to the task file."}}

## Deploy

{{HOW DEPLOY WORKS IN THIS PROJECT. Live URL, hosting service,
named-site / project / environment specifics, who has access, where
to find logs.}}

## Conventions

{{PROJECT-SPECIFIC CODE / DESIGN CONVENTIONS THAT AREN'T OBVIOUS
FROM READING THE CODE. Naming patterns, component shapes, data flow,
gotchas. Anything you'd tell a new contributor in their first hour.}}

## Pause points / open questions

{{KNOWN ROUGH EDGES, DEFERRED DECISIONS, THINGS THE TEAM IS AWARE OF
BUT HASN'T ADDRESSED. Honest about gaps. Empty is fine if there are
none.}}
